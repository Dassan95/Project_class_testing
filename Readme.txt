Title: Evaluation of two different yeast ingredients in the diet of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss
Objective
main: Assess the Impact of Yeast Ingredients on the Growth Performance of Rainbow Trout
specific-1: Examine the nutritional profiles of the experimental diets and the effects of yeast ingredients on proximate composition, gross energy consumption, and amino acid composition of diets and yeast ingredients.
specific-2: Quantify any fillet color alterations caused by adding yeast components.
Data to be used:
1. Growth Performance Data including weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and survival rate (SUR).
2. Data on Nutritional parameters including crude protein, crude lipid, crude ash, moisture, and gross energy consumption will be analyzed.
3. Digestibility Data will include proximate composition, gross energy consumption, mineral analysis, and amino acid composition of the diets and yeast ingredients.
4. Fillet Pigmentation Data using the Hunter Lab Miniscan EZ245 to assess any changes in pigmentation.
